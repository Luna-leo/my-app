# Combobox Mouse Wheel Scrolling Test Instructions

## Testing Steps:

1. Open the application at http://localhost:3001
2. Navigate to the Create Chart dialog (or wherever the X-axis and Y-axis parameter selection is located)
3. Click on the X-axis parameter dropdown
4. Once the dropdown is open, try scrolling with the mouse wheel
5. Verify that the list scrolls smoothly up and down
6. Repeat the same test for the Y-axis parameter dropdown

## Expected Behavior:
- Mouse wheel scrolling should work smoothly in both dropdowns
- Scrolling should stop at the top and bottom boundaries
- The scroll event should not propagate to parent elements (the page should not scroll)
- Keyboard navigation should still work (arrow keys, enter to select)

## What Was Fixed:
1. Added explicit wheel event handling to CommandList component
2. Added stopPropagation to prevent wheel events from bubbling up
3. Added onOpenAutoFocus prevention to avoid focus conflicts
4. Added wheel event handling to PopoverContent to ensure proper event capture

## Browser Compatibility:
The fix should work in all modern browsers including:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- Firefox
- Safari
